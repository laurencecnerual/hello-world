# hello-world
This is my grand debut back into programming.
It's been a few years since I've last coded. This is my first time using GitHub too.
I'm currently self-studying, and am going to be making and expanding upon some programs for practice.
The goal is to review CS fundamentals and brush up on syntax.
I hope you like what you see.
